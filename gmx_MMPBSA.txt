gmx_MMPBSA -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs md_100.tpr -ci index.ndx -cg 20 21 -ct md_100.xtc (-lm .mol2 for protein-ligand) (-cr .pdb)
- need to create new .ndx file without any ions included if there is an error with the COM.prmtop file (no data)
- -cg (protein) (ligand)

# PBC problem
- COM.prmtop, REC.prmtop was empty.
Create new .ndx file without any ions included!!!

- Sometimes you will see the failure notification like this;
"ValueError: could not convert string to float: '*************'
Exiting. All files have been retained."
This problem was related to PBC conditions.

# Update 1.5 problem 
- program freezes during this step "Cleaning normal complex trajectories..." and the file size of "COM_traj_0.xtc" stuck at around 709 mb.
> python -m pip install git+https://github.com/Valdes-Tresanco-MS/gmx_MMPBSA -U
or
> python -m pip install gmx_MMPBSA -U (if you installed with conda environment (pip))
or
> amber.python -m pip install gmx_MMPBSA -U (if you installed with AmberTools compilation)

**note that gmx_MMPBSA is not compatible with previous versions.
However, modifying the _GMXMMPBSA_info file could open the results in gmx_MMPBSA_ana.
